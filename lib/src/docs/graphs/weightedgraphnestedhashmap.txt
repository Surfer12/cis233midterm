nested HashMap, 
// - The outer key represents the source vertex
// - The inner map represents the destination vertices and their edge weights

// Here's a textual representation of the graph:

// - Vertex 1 connects to:
//   - Vertex 2 with weight 4
//   - Vertex 3 with weight 2

// - Vertex 2 connects to:
//   - Vertex 4 with weight 5
//   - Vertex 5 with weight 1

// - Vertex 3 connects to:
//   - Vertex 6 with weight 3

// - Vertices 4, 5, and 6 have no outgoing edges

// Visual Graph Representation:
```
    4
1 ------> 2 -----> 4
|  \      |
2    5    5 
|     \   |
v      v  v
3 -----> 6
```

Key observations:
1. This is a directed weighted graph
2. Not all vertices have connections
3. Weights are shown on the edges
4. Some vertices (4, 5, 6) are "terminal" or have no outgoing edges
