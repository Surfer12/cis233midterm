Mock Midterm Exam   Java Design and Object-Oriented Programming in Java exclusively.

Duration: 60 minutes
Instructions: Attempt all questions. Write clear and concise answers. Use proper Java syntax for coding questions. You may use a timer to simulate test-like conditions.

Section 1: Conceptual Questions (15 points) Java Design and Object-Oriented Programming in Java exclusively.

	1.	(5 points) Define the following terms:
	•	Depth of a tree 
     The depths of a tree is the number of edges on the path from the root to the node.
	•	Height of a tree 
    The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node. ( This is the same as the depth of the deepest node in the tree.)
	•	Binary Search Tree (BST) 
    A BST is a binary tree in which for each node, the value of all the nodes in the left subtree is less than the value of the node, and the value of all the nodes in the right subtree is greater than the value of the node.
	•	Auxiliary Space 
    The auxiliary space is the space required by an algorithm to complete its execution, excluding the space for input data.
	•	Encapsulation 
    Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world.
	2.	(5 points) Explain the difference between polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming with examples. 
	3.	(5 points) Describe how the space complexity of a recursive algorithm is determined and give an example of an algorithm with O(log n) space complexity.
       Polymorphism in java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
       An example of polymorphism is the ability of a car to take on many forms, such as a sedan, SUV, and truck. 
       Then the car can be treated as a single object, and its properties and methods can be used in different contexts.
       Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
	3.	(5 points) Describe how the space complexity of a recursive algorithm is determined and give an example of an algorithm with O(log n) space complexity.

Section 2: Algorithm Analysis (15 points) Java Design and Object-Oriented Programming in Java exclusively.

	1.	(5 points) Analyze the time complexity of the following Java method:

public int findMax(int[] arr) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}


	2.	(5 points) Write a recursive function to calculate the power of a number (base^exponent). Explain its time complexity.
	3.	(5 points) In a sorted array of size 128, how many comparisons would a binary search require in the worst case? Show your calculations.

Section 3: Data Structures (15 points) Java Design and Object-Oriented Programming in Java exclusively.

	1.	(5 points) Given the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], construct a balanced binary search tree (BST). Draw the tree structure and provide its in-order traversal.
	2.	(5 points) Explain the steps involved in performing a breadth-first search (BFS) and outline its time complexity.
	3.	(5 points) Consider the following tree:

      10
     /  \
    5    20
   / \   / \
  3   7 15  25

Perform a post-order traversal and list the nodes in the order they are visited.

Section 4: Coding Questions (25 points) Java Design and Object-Oriented Programming in Java exclusively.

	1.	(10 points) Implement a Java class for a binary tree node and write a method for in-order traversal:

class TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode left, right;

    public TreeNode(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

// Write an in-order traversal method here


	2.	(15 points) Implement a Java program that reads an adjacency matrix of a graph and performs BFS starting from node 0.

	1.	Identify questions you found challenging and revisit the corresponding topics in your study materials.
	2.	Rewrite or debug any incorrect code.
	3.	Practice similar problems to strengthen weak areas.
